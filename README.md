# Linty's Textures
Public collection of VFX related textures that I (Linty) have created.

These textures are 100% free to use by anyone for any purpose.
No credit is required, go nuts. Just don't claim that you made these yourself.

Apologies if my organization is messy.

--------------------------------

All of the textures are created by me, none are taken from asset packs. However a couple are heavy modifications of textures from Kenney's Particle Pack, which are also free to use without credit.

If you are somehow here without ever seeing Kenney's Particle Pack, I highly recommend you check it out.

Note: Any texture that has the suffix "PMA" means it has been premultiplied by alpha.
